A project for the odin project where-in I'll make a 2 player  game of tic tac toe to play in the terminal using ruby. To do this I'll have to utilize OOP and create classes that can handle the data needed and fullfill the methods needed to play the game. If there is time and I deem it worthwhile I might try and make an AIPlayer class so you can play it on your own.

Finalized: 
The game can be run from the console by running the play.rb file. After that, you simply have to follow the instructions in the terminal.
